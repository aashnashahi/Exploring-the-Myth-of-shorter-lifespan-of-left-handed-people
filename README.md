## 📖 Overview

This project investigates the long-standing claim that **left-handed people die younger**, by showing how changes in **age distribution and cohort effects** can produce a spurious appearance of a lifespan gap — even if left- and right-handed individuals have identical mortality. Using Bayesian modeling and demographic simulation, we test whether the original ~9-year difference can be explained entirely as an artifact of reporting bias.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Reconstruct how the prevalence of left-handedness varies with age and birth cohort  
- Model the true probability of left-handedness by birth year using Bayesian inference  
- Combine those prevalence estimates with actual death distributions to simulate expected age-at-death  
- Show that the observed “lifespan gap” can arise from cohort / reporting bias alone  
- Quantify uncertainty and perform sensitivity analyses
