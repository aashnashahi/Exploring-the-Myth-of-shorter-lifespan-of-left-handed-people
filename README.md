## 📖 Overview

This project investigates the long-standing claim that **left-handed people die younger**, by showing how changes in **age distribution and cohort effects** can produce a spurious appearance of a lifespan gap — even if left- and right-handed individuals have identical mortality. Using Bayesian modeling and demographic simulation, we test whether the original ~9-year difference can be explained entirely as an artifact of reporting bias.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📊 Analyze handedness prevalence across age groups and birth cohorts  
- 🧮 Model the true probability of left-handedness by birth year using Bayesian methods  
- 🔢 Combine modeled prevalence with real mortality data to simulate expected age-at-death  
- 🧠 Demonstrate that the lifespan gap can be reproduced **without any true mortality difference**  
- 📈 Visualize and interpret cohort effects clearly
